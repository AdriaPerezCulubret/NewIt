<h1>TABLES</h1>


<h3>Article</h3>
<p>Contains the articles and all the information relative to each specific article.</p>

<h3>Source</h3>
<p>Information about the sources (newspapers). Each newspaper could have several Feeds, thus the separation between the concepts "Feed" and "Source".
However, all the feeds coming from the same newspaper will share some information (homepage, logo...). This information will be added here in the form of news tables,
although we have not decided yet what will be important to store. That's why it has only one column for now.</p>

<h3>Category</h3>

<p>Hand-curated categories. Each feed (Feed, not Source!) will have a specific category assigned by us. We started working with these information in a plain text file, but we ended
up uploading it in the DB for convenience. The drop-down menu in the search engine queries this table to get all the available categories, allowing the user to choose.</p>

<h3>Feed</h3>
<p>These are the links from which the RSS come from. As said before, each newspaper will have several feeds, and each of them will have a category, a language, etc. The
application that uploads articles to the DBs queries this table.</p>

<h3>Bookmark</h3>
<p>In this table we store the users and their bookmarks. Each user will have several entries in this table (as much as bookmarks). The primary key is not important here,
it's just an autoincrement integer. If one article appears at least once in this table, the boolean Bookmark from the table article will be set to True.</p>

<h3>Feed_Subscription</h3>
<p>Each user will be able to subscribe to several newspapers (all by default). This table will store all the subscriptions for each user. Again, the primary key is an autoincrement
integer and each user will appear several times in this table (that's how we avoid having lists in columns).</p>

<h3>Search Subscription</h3>
<p>Our applications revolves around searches instead of sources. Users will be able to <b>subscribe</b> to searches they keep doing. Each search is defined by a
keyword and a category. These "subscriptions" will be stored in this table. Again, we use an auto-increment integer to avoid lists.</p>

    Example:
    <table style="width:100%">
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Paco</td>
            <td>Rajoy</td>
            <td>Pol√≠tica</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>Paco</td>
            <td>Messi</td>
            <td>Deportes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>Paco</td>
            <td>Podemos</td>
            <td>Opinion</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

<h3>Auth_user</h3>
<p>User information (passwords, permissions, email...)</p>
